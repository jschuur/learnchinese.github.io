Hi, I'm [Joost](https://twitter.com/joostschuur) and I'm (slowly) learning Mandarin Chinese. There's a lot of resources out there to help with that, and I love curating content, so I built this site to help others find [sites](/sites), [apps](/apps), [YouTube channels](/youtube), [podcasts](/podcasts) and more to guide them through learning this wonderful language.

My motto is 'launch, then improve', so I hope you'll enjoy this early version of the site, while I keep working on it.

有问题的话，请[邮件联系我](mailto:jschuur@jschuur.com).
